# Lab - Delete/Update

## Morning

Come up with a CRUDable model (fruit, human, robot, etc)

1. Set up a repo.
1. Create an express app. `.gitignore` your `node_modules`. Commit.
1. Create an array of your CRUDable objects. Commit.
1. Create an index route that displays all your objects. Commit.
1. In the index route, create a form which will make a DELETE request to the server.  Commit.
1. Create a DELETE route handler that will remove the specified object from the array and redirect to the index page. Commit.

## Afternoon

Expand the morning's app to have the following:

1. An edit route/page that populates the forms with the data from the server. Commit.
1. A link to the edit route on the index page. Commit.
1. A PUT route that will change the element of your objects array, as specified by the index in the URL, to req.body
    - this page should redirect back to the index route, once this is completed
    - the form on the edit page should make a PUT request to this route
    - Did you commit?
    
## Hungry for more?

1. Create a show page/route with links to it from the index page
1. The show page should have a link to the edit page
1. The edit page should have a delete button which will delete the specified item
>You're committing right?
